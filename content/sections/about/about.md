Hello there! I'm Alex, and I'm in my third year of Computer Science at Queen's University, with a degree focus in Data Analytics and Machine Learning. After my first year, I decided to also pursue a Smith School of Business *Certificate in Business*, as I knew I wanted to do more than just develop software in my career.

I have a number of passions, from general computer topics, to software development, music (of all forms!), cycling, and badminton, but have most recently developed a love for data. I crave the feeling of satisfaction I get from turning a huge dataset into a simple visualization and applicable insights.

I'm always looking for new challenges, and enjoy few things more than being stuck behind a good roadblock. They create opportunities for creativity and innovation, which is where great ideas come from.

For more information about my skill set, interests, and projects, continue reading down the page and check out my resume in the top right corner! I'm glad to have you here :)
