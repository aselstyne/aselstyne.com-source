Hello there! I'm Alex, and I'm in my fourth year of Computer Science at Queen's University, with a degree focus in Data Analytics and Machine Learning. I'm additionally pursuing a Smith School of Business *Certificate in Business*.

Professionally, my interests are mostly in AI/ML. I'm currently a research assistant to Dr. Mariam El Mezouar at the Royal Military College of Canada, where I'm studying applications of fine-tuned LLMs. Moving forward, I'm most interested in AI for biology, drug discovery, and other healthcare related topics.

I'm always looking for new challenges, and enjoy few things more than being stuck behind a good roadblock. They create opportunities for creativity and innovation, which is where great ideas come from.

For more information about my skill set, interests, and projects, continue reading down the page and check out my resume in the top right corner!
